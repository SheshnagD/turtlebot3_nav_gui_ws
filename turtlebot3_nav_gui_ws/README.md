# ROS 2 TurtleBot3 Autonomous Navigation with GUI

This project demonstrates autonomous waypoint navigation for the TurtleBot3 robot in a custom Gazebo world using **ROS 2 Humble**.  
It integrates the **Navigation2 (Nav2)** stack with a **Tkinter-based GUI** that allows users to select one or more waypoints for the robot to visit autonomously.

---

##  Overview

The system enables a simulated TurtleBot3 to:
- Navigate to predefined waypoints within a custom world.
- Handle both single and multiple waypoint missions.
- Display live navigation status on a simple GUI.
- Return to the Home position automatically after completing navigation.

All components â€” Gazebo world, navigation stack, GUI, and waypoint manager â€” are launched together through a single launch file for smooth integration.

##  Features

- **Custom Gazebo world** with 2D map (`custom_map.pgm`, `custom_map.yaml`).
- **Tkinter GUI** with labeled buttons for:
  - Station A  
  - Station B  
  - Station C  
  - Station D  
  - Docking Station  
  - Home
- GUI options:
  - Select single or multiple waypoints.
  - Display navigation progress (`Navigating`, `Reached`, `Failed`).
  - Cancel navigation during execution.
- **Waypoint Manager Node**:
  - Sends goals to Nav2â€™s `NavigateToPose` action server.
  - Handles feedback, success, and failure cases.
  - Returns robot to Home after completing all selected goals.
- **Single Launch Integration**:
  - Starts Gazebo world, Nav2 stack, waypoint manager, and GUI together.
